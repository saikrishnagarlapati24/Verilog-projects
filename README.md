# Verilog-projects
This repository contains the files that are used in my Verilog projects
This verilog project is the implementation of a 4*4 multiplier using verilog programming language. 
One of the multiplicands is multiplied with each bit of the multiplicand generating 4 partial products. The four partial products are added using 3 Ladner-Fischer adder which is a modification
to Kogge-stone adder. This algorithm allows multiplication to be logarithmic time complexity.
